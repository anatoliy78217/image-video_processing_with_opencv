to compile: 

mac osx:
the makefile provided is for my own use and will only work on a mac with g++ installed and opencv installed from macports, even in that case you need to edit it and uncomment the targets you want to compile

linux/POSIX:
edit the makefile and update it with the proper link and include flags so that it points to where you have installed opencv headers and libraries

windows:
I have no idea.. I haven't used windows for ages.. 

then just
mkdir build
make
